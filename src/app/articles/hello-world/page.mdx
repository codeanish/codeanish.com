I've lost count of the number of times that I've updated/recreated my website. 
Let's be honest, every time I do it, it's almost always a complete rewrite.

The first iteration of my site (in 2010) has now been lost to the ether and
was codeinthemorning.com. Looking back at the web.archive.com, it seems almost
entirely lost at this point. I can only find one article I wrote about SQL Server
data types. All styling and formatting has been lost. This is probably for the
best.

A couple of years ago, I thought it had been a long time since I did any web
development, so I thought I'd brush up my skills and make myself a basic site. 
The home of this site is the same as this current site, codeanish.com. I built the
site using Gatsby.

## Moving forward

At this point, I'm coding regularly (just check out my Github contribution graph), and
felt as though a redesign with additional features was necessary. 
I liked how quick my existing site was, owing to it being a static generated site, and how it fits my aesthetic.
However, it lacked a bunch of features that I didn't take the time to build, like a 
blog or a home for a digital garden. Many of these things would have been achievable 
using Gatsby, but I wanted to give NextJS a go - given it's the new hotness in town
and Gatsby seems to have died a death.

Now I have the bones of a good design and a blog, so I can happily publish
posts on things that I find interesting and deem worthy of sharing. I hope you 
enjoy the posts to come and enjoy the journey with me.

I'm sure this is not the last re-design of this site, but I can probably confidently say
that this is the last re-design of this site in 2024 at least ðŸ˜€.
